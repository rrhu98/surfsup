# Lobby Service

Lobby Service is a RESTful API that manages the creation and deletion of multiplayer lobbies, including the players that make up the lobby for our game.

Its the underlying architecture used to facilitate players to create multiplayer games given their custom game parameters, and allows the created game to be discovered and joined by players on another network.
